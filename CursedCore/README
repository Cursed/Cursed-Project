CactusEMU is a World of Warcraft game server emulator. It is derived
from Trinity Core, itself derived from MaNGOS. CactusEMU is based on their code.

API documentation can be obtained by running the "make doc" command inside
the doc directory.

SQL files to create the database can be found in the sql directory. Files
to update your database from an older revision/version can be found in the
sql/updates directory.

The extractor *needs* that you finished *all* the updates of the client.
It includes the small updates at the end.
You should also verify that the accountType setting is set to "CT" in your WTF/launcher.wtf and WTF/config.wtf.

See the docs/UnixInstall.txt file for installation instructions on Linux.
